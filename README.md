# CovidUI

CovidUI is a simple App to Track the status of Covid-19 around the World.

This is a simple App I made to track the spread of Covid-19 for me and my family. And decided to share it with whoever wants to use it.

This App is intended as an experiment in API and UX design. It uses GraphQL and a set of experimental tools to integrate it with SwiftUI. It is not intended to be your main source of information. Make sure you consult multiple sources when it comes to informing yourself about sensitive topics.

I personally recommend the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int) and the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/).

## How does this work

![](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/Graphaello/raw/master/logo.png)
This was made using [Graphaello](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/Graphaello). A tool to use GraphQL directly from SwiftUI.

It's querying the data from [CovidQL](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/CovidQL) which is loading data from [NovelCOVID](https://github.com/novelcovid/api)

Please stay safe and stay home.
